Documenting my free study for the aws devops professional exam

There are many paid practice exams and courses to prepare for the Certified AWS DevOps Engineer - Professional Exam. 

I'm documenting my learnings starting from the [exam guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-devops-pro/AWS-Certified-DevOps-Engineer-Professional_Exam-Guide.pdf) from aws and attempting to pass the exam with only free resources to prepare for it. 

I'm hoping this helpful for others as well.
